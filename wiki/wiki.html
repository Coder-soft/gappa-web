                <p><strong>Myth</strong>: If something is copyrighted, you can’t use it at all.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact</strong>: Copyright law does not strictly prohibit all uses of copyrighted materials. There are many circumstances under which you can use copyrighted content legally without permission. This is due to specific allowances and exceptions under copyright law.</p>
                <h3 id="1-fair-use">1. Fair Use</h3>
                <p>Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission, typically for purposes like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Criticism and Commentary</strong>: Using portions of a work to discuss or critique it.</li>
                <li><strong>News Reporting</strong>: Excerpting or quoting from a work for news purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational Purposes</strong>: Using materials in educational settings, such as classrooms.</li>
                <li><strong>Parody and Satire</strong>: Creative works that make fun of or critique an original work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Factors courts consider for fair use:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose and Character</strong> of the use (e.g., commercial vs. educational).</li>
                <li><strong>Nature of the Copyrighted Work</strong> (e.g., factual vs. fictional).</li>
                <li><strong>Amount and Substantiality</strong> of the portion used.</li>
                <li><strong>Effect on the Market</strong> for the original work.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="2-creative-commons-and-open-licensing">2. Creative Commons and Open Licensing</h3>
                <p>Some creators choose to license their work openly, allowing others to use, share, or modify it with minimal or no restrictions.</p>
                <p>Creative Commons licenses, for instance, specify conditions like:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Attribution</strong> (crediting the creator).</li>
                <li><strong>Non-commercial Use</strong> (no use for profit).</li>
                <li><strong>Share-Alike</strong> (sharing derivative works under the same terms).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="3-public-domain">3. Public Domain</h3>
                <p>Works in the public domain are not protected by copyright and can be used freely. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Works whose copyright has expired.</li>
                <li>Works explicitly placed in the public domain by their creators.</li>
                <li>Certain government publications (depending on the country).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="4-educational-and-library-exceptions">4. Educational and Library Exceptions</h3>
                <p>Many jurisdictions allow specific copyright exceptions for educational institutions, libraries, and archives to preserve, share, or display works for public benefit.</p>
                <h3 id="5-licenses-and-permissions">5. Licenses and Permissions</h3>
                <p>Copyright owners can give permission for others to use their work through a license.</p>
                <p>Licensing agreements can outline specific rights, like showing a movie in a classroom or using images on a website, and can be flexible or restrictive depending on the terms.</p>
                <h3 id="6-transformative-uses">6. Transformative Uses</h3>
                <p>Courts sometimes allow the use of copyrighted work if it is “transformative” enough – meaning it adds new meaning, expression, or message to the original.</p>
                <p>This can apply to remixing music, creating fan art, or adapting stories, but transformative use can be a grey area.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
                <p>Copyright laws provide protections for creators but also have exceptions and allowances for certain uses. Misunderstanding these rights can lead to overly restrictive views on content use. Always check if an exception or license might apply to your intended use, as it may be permitted within copyright boundaries.</p>
